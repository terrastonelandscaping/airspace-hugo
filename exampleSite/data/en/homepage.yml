    content: Recently used Terrastone Landscaping Inc. to replace my 20x35 ft patio
      and my drive way. I am very happy with the results. I requested estimates from
      5 companies. Joseph was one of the two companies who showed up. I felt his quote
      was fair and decided to use his company for the job. They had to remove 2 layers
      of concrete in the back patio. (very Difficult) We thought the job would take
      5 days. It actually took 8 because of the rain delays. His crew was excellent,
      they worked long and hard, left the job site clean and tidy. I've had nothing
      but compliments since the work was done. I am one happy customer!

    content: We hired Joe and his team to renovate our patio and build a pergola.
      The crew were nice to work with, full of ideas and listened to our requirements.
      They did what they were hired to do and more. They were on time and kept to
      their budget. I would hire them again and would recommend them to anyone who
      asks.

    content: I contacted Joey at Terrastone to 'touch up' my front and backyard last
      year before I sold my house. I was referred by another friend of mine and I
      believe Joey and his team did an excellent job. I had visitors complimenting
      my yard during my open-house sessions. The project took roughly 2-weeks (from
      what I remember), and I didn't have much issue at all. It was a pretty well
      done job and just as I expected.
